# Plan
My initial plan is to design a system in which messages can be sent between devices via Bluetooth and be passed around by users in close vicinity which would ultimately result in them being geographically propagated and ultimately reaching an internet connection which would allow them to sent all over the globe to listeners with internet connection and also dynamic nodes which would be able to move the messages to another location.

This does not require an internet connection to begin the process so would be a solution to problems surrounding the lack of signal such as war zones or natural disasters. Those inside the zones would be able to send messages to the outside world and one another, albeit slowly, with no internet connection.

## The technology
The technology used in government contact tracing apps is perfect for this.

Devices would be able to act as beacons and transmit the messages to one another.

Unfortunately, the technology, for obvious reasons, is not available for normal developers to use and is limited to governments. However, I plan to design and build a mock implementation and a model for showing how such a system would work and how it would help those in need. 

### Mockup
The mockup will be built in React to allow for easy demonstration across platforms. The similarity to React Native would allow it to be easily developed into an app.

A simulated interaction from a fake device will be used.

A potential mockup server will be used. This will be implemented in TypeScript.

The mockup can be seen deployed on my website: (https://jayhal.es/hackvcis2022).
